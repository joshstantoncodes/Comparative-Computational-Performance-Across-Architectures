# Comparative Computational Performance Across Architectures
This project was created to assess the different performaces of computer architectures for statistical analysis of large datasets.
To evaluate performance, 3.3 million data points of lung cancer miRNA expressions in .tsv files underwent statistical analyses on the following architectures: Apple M1 Pro, Intel i5-7200U, Intel i5-12400F, Intel i7-6820HQ, Intel i7-12650H, and Ryzen 9 6900HX.
